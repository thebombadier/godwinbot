######What is /u/godwin_finder ?

Godwin_finder is a bot that searches through all the top rated submissions and checks for a reference to the Nazis or Hitler in the comments. It will then post a reply to that comment stating how long it took for the post to acquire a comment that referenced Hitler.

######What is the point ?

Godwin's Law states that, if an internet conversation goes on for long enough eventually Hitler or the Nazis will be referenced, no matter how unrelated the original subject of the post. This bot is here to test that 'law'.
